# java-to-python-translator
Translate Java code to its Python Equivalent. Continuous work in progress.

The default file to run is "J2P_App.py"

I will be adding comments to the documents to show logic soon.

## Notes:

This was made for a senior project, so the code translates the basic aspects of OOP used in Java.
